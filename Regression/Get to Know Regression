What is Regression?
Regression is a type of Supervised Learning where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (e.g., house price, temperature, sales revenue).

Types of Regression Models
Here are the most common types of regression models:

1.Linear Regression (Simple & Multiple):
2.Polynomial Regression
3.Ridge & Lasso Regression
4.Logistic Regression 

Other Models:
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Works well for high-dimensional datasets.
Decision Trees/Random Forest Regression: Non-linear models that split the data based on decision rules.
Neural Networks for Regression: Handles complex non-linear relationships using deep learning.
