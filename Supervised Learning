What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised Learning is like learning with a teacher.
The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct answers (outputs) are already known.
The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between the inputs (features) and the outputs (labels) so it can predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

Key Components of Supervised Learning:
Inputs (Features):
These are the pieces of information used to make predictions.
Example: In predicting house prices, inputs could be square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
Outputs (Labels):
These are the correct answers or targets the model tries to predict.
Example: The price of the house (output) based on the inputs.
Model:
A mathematical representation that maps inputs to outputs.
Example: A linear regression model might predict house prices as:
Price = (Size * Weight1) + (Location * Weight2) + Bias
Training:
The process of showing the model the input-output pairs so it learns the pattern.

Two Types of Supervised Learning Problems
Regression (Continuous Outputs):
Predict a numerical value.
Example: Predicting house prices, temperature, or stock prices.

Classification (Categorical Outputs):
Predict a category or label.
Example: Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam), disease diagnosis (Positive or Negative).
