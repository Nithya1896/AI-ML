Supervised Learning
The model is trained on labeled data (i.e., input and the correct output).
Example: A spam email detector trained on emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam."

Unsupervised Learning
The model is given data without labels and must find patterns on its own.
Example: Grouping customers into segments based on their shopping habits.

Semi-Supervised Learning
The model learns from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
Example: A face recognition system that starts with a few labeled images ("John," "Emma") and improves by analyzing many unlabeled images.

Reinforcement Learning
The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
Example: A self-driving car learning to navigate roads by getting rewards for safe driving
