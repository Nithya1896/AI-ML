Artificial Intelligence (AI):
AI is the big pictureâ€”the field focused on creating machines that can think, reason, and act intelligently like humans.
Example: A self-driving car that drives safely, recognizes road signs, and makes decisions like a human driver.

Machine Learning (ML):
ML is one of the tools or techniques used to make machines "smart" like humans.
It allows machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
Example: Teaching a self-driving car to recognize stop signs by showing it thousands of stop sign images.

Think of AI as the goal and ML as one of the paths to achieve that goal. ðŸ˜Š

To make a machine exhibit Artificial Intelligence (AI), we often feed it intelligence through data and train it using machine learning (ML) models. Hereâ€™s how it works step by step:
1. Intelligence Comes from Data
Machines donâ€™t "think" naturally; they rely on data to understand and learn.
Example: To create a chatbot, you feed it conversations (data) so it can learn how humans talk.
2. Machine Learning Models Act as Teachers
The ML model is like the teacher that helps the machine process and make sense of the data.
It learns patterns, rules, and logic from the data to perform tasks like making predictions or decisions.
3. AI in Action
Once trained, the machine can use what it learned to perform intelligent tasks on its own.
Example:
A trained ML model can help AI recognize faces in photos, drive a car, or detect spam emails.
Without ML, the AI would struggle to "act intelligently" because it wouldnâ€™t have learned anything.
